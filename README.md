# ðŸ“˜ Flowsense's Documentation

There's nothing inside this repo except a Wiki that you can access [here](https://github.com/SatuSattr/flwsns-docs/wiki)

but if you accidentally stumbled upon this repo from my github page, let me tell you about <b>Flowsense!</b></br>flowsense is a Minecraft plugin for real-time donation system integration into the game using backend polling. Perfect for servers that want to display donations from Saweria, Trakteer, or Tako <b>directly into the server</b> with cool and automatic notifications.

> ðŸ˜… **Disclaimer:** the orignal project is closed sourse so i make the docs at a different repo
